Floating Camera: always-on-top/picture-in-picture MacOS webcam/iSight/security camera live feed viewer.  
Notarized/hardened/sandboxed
https://github.com/Oil3/Floating-Camera/

What is this: this is is a MacOS app that uses available camera/webcam/iSight in order to display the video feed live, full 16/9 view (non-cropped), resizable, always-on-top (picture in picture).  
Native, notarized, sandboxed, hardened, and coded using no dependeny, no external libraries and only the required code.

How to install? Move the extracted app in /Applications, or anywhere you choose.

How to use? Run the app, its window floats on top of all other windows. Resize by the edges/corners. You can notice a wider effective field-of-view than PhotoBooth: app uses all visible, and is non-mirrored.

Floating Camera was initially tought so I could check on _those weird noises_ that I heard downstairs most nights.

Downstairs I have a powerhouse but broken screen macbookpro m1 max to which I connect via SSH or apple remote desktop/screen sharing to do all the Machine Learning work, and also to see from its iSight camera.

FYI Amazingly the noises were from two cats that sneaked in through a window I leave ajar.
